Due to submission issues (files too large), we decided to create a FromSmash link for the sector and raw_csv folders, which you can extract.

After extraction, you should move the folder inside each extracted file into the csvs_processing directory:

 - https://fromsmash.com/raw-csvs-and-sector


As an alternative, you can also clone our GitHub repository:
